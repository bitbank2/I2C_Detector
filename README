The purpose of this project is to provide a small bit of code which can not
only scan an I2C bus for devices, but identify those devices. I have a need for
this in one of my projects where I was testing three different accelerometers
and dynamically swapping between them. I thought that it could benefit others
as well. Here are some scenarios where I thought it might be helpful:

1) You've got an unmarked I2C device or one with misleading markings that you
   would like to identify.

2) You're prototyping a project which uses multiple I2C devices and you're not
   sure if you set the address select bits correctly on each one.

3) You're comparing sensors from multiple manufacturers and you would like to
   swap them without having to recompile your code.

4) You're hacking on a mystery device and would like to know what's inside.

This code can use the Wire library or my BitBang_I2C library:

Most of the 19 devices currently detected are from STMicro because they're
very consistent about having a "WHO_AM_I" register to identify each of their
parts. Here are the currently recognized devices:

SSD1306, SH1106, VL53L0X, BMP180, BMP280, BME280, MPU-60x0, MPU-9250, MCP9808, LSM6DS3, ADXL345, ADS1115, MAX44009, MAG3110, CCS811, HTS221, LPS25H, LSM9DS1, DS3231
